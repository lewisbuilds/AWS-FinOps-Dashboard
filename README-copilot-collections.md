## ðŸ§ª Test Execution & Coverage

### Quick Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
poetry run pytest

# Run with coverage summary
poetry run pytest --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing

# Generate HTML coverage report
poetry run pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html

# Run only FinOps analyzer tests
poetry run pytest tests/test_finops.py -v

# Run a single test by keyword
poetry run pytest -k "anomalies" -vv
```

- Minimum overall: 80%
- Core logic (`finops.py`): 90%+
- Session management (`aws_session.py`): 85%+

### Tips
- Use fixtures in `tests/conftest.py` to avoid duplication
